    <string name="discard">     Dealer \(switches off\) deals 6 cards to each player.
        Dealer then cuts deck, and non-dealer flips over top card.
        \(One point goes to the non-dealer if the card flipped over is a Jack.\)
        Each player discards two cards from their hand to the \'crib\'.</string>
    <string name="duel">        Non-dealer lays a card face up, followed by dealer and alternating.
        Ranks of cards are summed. Points are gained by owner of last card played if\:
            1\) Total = 15 \(\+2 pts\),
            2\) Previous card\(s\) have same rank as placed card (+2 pts per pair),
            3\) Any permutation of 3 or more straight cards forms a run (+n pts)
        The Total is capped at 31. If player has no valid cards, say \"Go\". Opponent must play cards until no valid move.
        Gains 2 pts for total \= 31, 1 pt otherwise. Sum resets, play continues with next player\'s card until no cards remain.
        The cards available for scoring during this phase usually reset with the round score, but to simplify, this is not true for this project. </string>
    <string name="count">        Each player recollects their cards into their hand.
        Non-dealer tallies up points within hand and flipped card\:
            \+2 pts for any combination of cards totaling 15
            \+2 pts for any pair \(thus +6 pts for triple and +12 pts for quadruple\)
            \+n pts for a run of n \(must be 3 or more\)
            \+1 pt if hand contains jack of the same suit as flipped card
        Process repeats with dealer\'s hand, then with \"crib\" \(points go to dealer\)</string>
