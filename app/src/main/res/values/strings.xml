    <string name="discard">     Dealer \(switches off\) deals 6 cards to each player.
        Dealer then cuts deck, and non-dealer flips over top card.
        \(One point goes to the non-dealer if the card flipped over is a Jack.\)
        Each player discards two cards from their hand to the \'crib\'.</string>
    <string name="duel">        Non-dealer lays a card face up, followed by dealer and alternating.
        Ranks of cards are summed. Points are gained by owner of last card played if\:
            1\) Total = 15 \(\+2 pts\),
            2\) Previous card\(s\) have same rank as placed card (+2 pts per pair),
            3\) Any permutation of 3 or more straight cards forms a run (+n pts)
        The Total is capped at 31. If player has no valid cards, say \"Go\". Opponent must play cards until no valid move.
        Gains 2 pts for total \= 31, 1 pt otherwise. Sum resets, play continues with next player\'s card until no cards remain. </string>

            \+2 pts for any pair \(thus +6 pts for triple and +12 pts for quadruple\)
            \+n pts for a run of n \(must be 3 or more\)
            \+1 pt if hand contains jack of the same suit as flipped card
        Process repeats with dealer\'s hand, then with \"crib\" \(points go to dealer\)</string>
